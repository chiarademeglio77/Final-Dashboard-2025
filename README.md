This dashboard is a high-level technical and operational oversight tool designed to track the recovery and stabilization of the STC Autoscuola ERP 2025 project as it reaches Week 29. It translates complex development data—such as Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and Sprint Velocity—into business-centric metrics to help leadership understand exactly how fast the team is moving and where capacity risks remain.

The visual layout focuses on three key pillars: delivery speed, operational efficiency, and software quality. By showcasing a clear transition from high-latency handovers and slow bug resolution in the early stages to the current state of high-velocity sprints and rapid defect fixes, the dashboard serves as proof of a successful process turnaround. Ultimately, it identifies remaining high-risk technical hurdles, such as critical security vulnerabilities, to ensure that the final push toward release is data-driven and transparent.
